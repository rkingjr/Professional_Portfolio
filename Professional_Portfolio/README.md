The technologies section outlines the web development technologies I have experience using.

The About Me section includes a timeline of important events in my life leading up to this point.

The footer contains my e-mail and phone number as well as links to my GitHub and Linkedin.

## Acknowledgements:

This portfolio was created with the help of the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPaLnMw2i_0

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/portfolio_website

Since this was the first time using React since finishing the course, this tutorial helped me immensely.

I was able to work on each component and see how it worked throughout the entire application as I went through the code and implemented it into my own app.

I was also able to see a wide variety of components that I will be able to use in future applications.

## Application Walkthrough:
